                                    My sales team will close the leads you bring to them. I only have A Player phone assassins that work entirely out of commission,
                                    and have minimum quotas they have to reach every month. We only hire and train the best, rest
                                    assured, this same team is with you. You will only have to take care of their closing fee from
                                    the sale generated, so it’s super scalable.
