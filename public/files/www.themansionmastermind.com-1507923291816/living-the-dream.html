                Failures are a part of life. Not a successful person will ever tell you that all he experienced was success from the beginning. 
                Not a single person is exempted from experiencing failures as long as he lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coach Giani is one of the business magnate who has gone through tough times before he got to where he is now. 
                If you get to know his story, you will know that it is not all success that he experienced. 
                Before he discovered the gold mine on the internet, he experienced getting fired from his job in Corporate America several times. 
                He had this situation at an unexpected time. He has a family to feed and no house to stay because he was facing foreclosure and bankruptcy. 
                When all of these happened, he decided to change his life.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his pursuit to change his life for his family’s future, he started dreaming for the life he wanted for them. 
                He envisioned the home where he would want his family to live. He envisioned the kind of life he wanted to give them. 
                When he started out on the internet, he didn’t have enough means to start his internet business. 
                Because he knew he had to do something, he started promoting his mentors and sending traffics to events they were conducting until such time that he already started to earn for himself. 
                Little by little, he began reaching for his dreams. In a span of three years, he made it big and was changing lives of people who want to follow his footsteps. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Up to this day, Coach Giani believes that being broke will never be a hindrance for someone who is determined to change his life the way he did. 
                However, when Coach Giani extends his help to people, he doesn’t make it easy. 
                He believes that if you want to find your way up, you have to work for it. According to the online business mogul, 
                you cannot build a business if you do not have the right mindset. This is the first step that anyone with the desire to build an online business should have in order to get to his goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are 5 things that you should have if you want to venture for an online business: <br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Have the right mindset.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Focus until it works.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Scale when it is already working.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Build a team when scaling.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Diversify after building a team.<br>

            </p>
            <p>
                One way of having the right mindset is to join the 30-Day Challenge that Coach Giani put up for everyone. 
                The challenges that he put up there will be able to help anyone in having the right mindset before he decides to build his online business. 
                Why is having the right mindset important? It is because this attracts cash flow. 
                It also makes you focused in mastering the needed skills for the business. When you have the skills, you will be able to run your business smoothly. 
                More importantly, having the right mindset gives you the will to continue with your business regardless of the problems you might encounter along the way. 
                It will make you prepared in facing the obstacles you may have.
